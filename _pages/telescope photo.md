Hi! This is Xianghan Cui (崔翔翰), welcome to my research homepage. 

I'm a fourth-year PhD candidate in astrophysics from the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by [Di Li](http://groups.bao.ac.cn/ism/english/chiefscientist/202204/t20220415_695884.html) and [Chengmin Zhang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zhangcm?language=en).  Currently, I'm researching at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research/Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy for one-year visiting PhD project, supervised by [Clancy James](https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/clancy-james-9504b0ca/). My main interests are in fast radio bursts (FRB) and pulsars, but I'm curious about everything in the universe.

Recently, I am focusing on the CHIME/FRB data and analyzing the population characteristics of FRBs using highly comprehensive statistical methods.

## Fast Radio Burst

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) may be is one of the most important and unique discoveries in the field of radio astronomy in the past decade or so. Its significance lies in the huge burst luminosity (isotropic), remote distances, and its brief flashes. And its uniqueness lies in the fact that, to this day, we still do not know where they originate from and the potential inspiration they may provide for new physics. In such a process, the aspects that interest me are statistical research and the physical mechanisms involved.

### Statistical Analysis

In the statistical aspect, I am attempting to analyze the statistical characteristics of FRBs using statistical methods to uncover the population distribution of them. In this way, we may be able to provide some clues about the origin and mechanisms of FRBs. 

In the previous works, we analyzed both [repeating and non-repeating FRBs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.3275C/abstract) based on the data available at that time (in mid-2020) and found that they exhibit different statistical distributions in terms of their intrinsic pulse widths and isotropic radio luminosities. During this process, we applied statistical methods to small samples for the first time, enhancing the comprehensiveness of our statistics. This led to an earlier perspective of the potential diversity of FRBs, suggesting that they might have multiple astrophysical origins or mechanisms.

Later, we conducted a statistical analysis of the [isotropic luminosity distribution](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Ap%26SS.367...66C/abstract) using the data of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1. To account for the influence of DM errors on distance more reasonably, we introduced different distributions and scales of DM-z conversion errors when estimating distances using the Macquart relation. We found that when the errors were less than 40%, the log-normal characteristics of the distribution were more pronounced compared to the power-law distribution. However, beyond this point, the log-normal characteristics gradually decreased. This result further indicated the crucial importance of an accurate DM-z relation in obtaining the intrinsic population of FRBs.

### Mechanism Model

The mechanism of FRBs is another significant question in this field. Currently, there are numerous models, such as propagation mechanism models and radiation mechanism models, proposed to explain FRBs. Here, we are particularly interested in how FRBs emit radiation. While there is still some disagreement regarding this issue like inside or outside the magnetosphere, coherent radiation is generally acknowledged as a key aspect of FRB emission. Therefore, we built our model with this perspective.

Our model is constructed within the framework of coherent curvature radiation and magnetized neutron stars. In these kind models, it is generally believed that coherent curvature radiation is produced by bunches moving along curved magnetic field lines, and the generation of these bunches is one of the fundamental issues in such models. Therefore, the core of our model focuses on how these bunches are formed before the emission of FRBs. Here, we propose a new approach that outflowing particles undergo an energy loss process dominated by Inverse Compton Scattering. This process leads to a [compression effect](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230810258C/abstract) in the particle flow (imagine a toll booth on a high-speed highway), which could potentially facilitate the formation of bunches.

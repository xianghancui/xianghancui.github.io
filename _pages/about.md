Hi! This is Xianghan Cui (崔翔翰), welcome to my research homepage. 

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics at the National Astronomical Observatories (NAOC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON), working with Prof Pei Wang, Prof. Di Li, and Prof. Joeri van Leeuwen. I obtained my PhD degree from NAOC in June 2025, supervised by Prof. Di Li and Prof. Chengmin Zhang. My main interests are in fast radio bursts (FRB) and pulsars, but I'm curious about everything in the universe.

My current research interests focus on understanding the origin of FRBs. This includes multi-band observations using FAST, LOFAR, and DART to investigate the time and frequency dependent properties of FRB, as well as continued population studies based on CHIME/FRB catalog, FAST/CRAFTS, and FRBPOPPY code.

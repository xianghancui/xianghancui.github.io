Hi! This is Xianghan Cui (Â¥îÁøîÁø∞), welcome to my research homepage. 

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics at the National Astronomical Observatories (NAOC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by. I obtained my PhD degree from NAOC in June 2025, supervised by [Di Li](http://groups.bao.ac.cn/ism/english/chiefscientist/202204/t20220415_695884.html) and [Chengmin Zhang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zhangcm?language=en). My main interests are in fast radio bursts (FRB) and pulsars, but I'm curious about everything in the universe.

Recently, I have been focusing on CHIME/FRB data to analyze the population characteristics of FRBs, as well as their origins.

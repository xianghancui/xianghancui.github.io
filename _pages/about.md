Hi! My name is Xianghan Cui (å´”ç¿”ç¿°), welcome to my research homepage. 

I'm a third-year PhD student in astrophysics at National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([NAOC](http://english.nao.cas.cn)), advised by [Di Li](http://groups.bao.ac.cn/ism/english/chiefscientist/202204/t20220415_695884.html) and [Chengmin Zhang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zhangcm?language=en).  Recently, I'm in International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research ([ICRAR](https://www.icrar.org))/Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy ([CIRA](https://astronomy.curtin.edu.au)) for one year PhD student, supervised by [Clancy James](https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/clancy-james-9504b0ca/). My main research interests are in fast radio bursts (FRB) and pulsars, but I'm curious about everything in the universe.
